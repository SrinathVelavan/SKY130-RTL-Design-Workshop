## Project Scope

The project provides a detailed account of the 5-day workshop facilitated by VSD on RTL Design in Verilog using the SKY130 Technology. 

SKY130 is the hardware industry's first open-source process design kit (PDK) released by SkyWater Technology Foundry in collaboration with Google giving all hardware design experts and aficionados, a worldwide access to their IP functions and open source ASICs. More details [here.](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk)

This particular workshop covers the various aspects of design in Verilog HDL both theoretically and practically with labs using open-source softwares through their VSD-IAT portal. Beginning with an introduction to digital design using Verilog HDL, the instructors cover digital design steps that include design, functional simulation, test bench based validation of the design functionality and logic Synthesis with optimization. Further, we learn about efficient verilog coding styles that result in a predictable logic in Silicon.
